# 📊 IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project (2008–2024)

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 17 seasons of Indian Premier League (IPL) data, from 2008 to 2024, using Python. It uncovers scoring patterns, batting styles, bowling consistency, and venue behavior, and even includes an optional match-winner prediction using Logistic Regression.


## 📁 Dataset Overview

The following datasets were used:

- `IPL_BallByBall2008_2024_Updated.csv` — Ball-by-ball match data  
- `ipl_teams_2024_info.csv` — Team metadata  
- `Players_Info_2024.csv` — Player metadata  
- `team_performance_dataset_2008to2024.csv` — Match-level outcomes and metrics


## 🔍 Project Highlights

- 📈 **Run Trends**: Year-wise scoring progression  
- 🏏 **Batting Styles**: Anchor vs Aggressive profiles  
- 🎯 **Bowling Consistency**: Dot % and economy rate visualizations  
- ⏱️ **Over Phases**: Powerplay, Middle, and Death overs impact  
- 🗺️ **Venue Analysis**: High vs low-scoring venue behavior  
- 🔮 **Match Outcome Prediction** (Optional): Logistic regression and ROC curve

## ✅ Final Conclusion
This analysis sheds light on evolving gameplay strategies, impactful venues, and player performance patterns throughout IPL history. It combines storytelling with data visualization to provide a clearer understanding of the game's dynamics.
