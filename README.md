# 📊 IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project (2008–2024)

This project dives deep into 17 seasons of IPL data (2008 to 2024), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. It uncovers patterns in scoring, player performance, match dynamics, and team strategies — visualized using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The following CSV files were used:

- `IPL_BallByBall2008_2024_Updated.csv` — Ball-by-ball match data  
- `ipl_teams_2024_info.csv` — Team details  
- `Players_Info_2024.csv` — Player metadata  
- `team_performance_dataset_2008to2024.csv` — Team-level match outcomes

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📈 **Run Trends** – Year-wise scoring patterns  
- 🏏 **Batting Styles** – Anchor vs Aggressive players  
- 🎯 **Bowling Consistency** – Dot ball %, economy rate  
- ⏱️ **Over Phases** – Powerplay, Middle, Death  
- 🗺️ **Venue Analysis** – Top venues and scoring bias  
- 🔮 **Match Winner Prediction** – Logistic Regression model (optional)


## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shinjini708/ipl-eda-2008-2024.git
   cd ipl-eda-2008-2024

## ✅ Conclusion

This IPL data analysis provided meaningful insights into team strategies, player performance, and scoring patterns across seasons. By leveraging Python and visualization tools, we uncovered trends in batting styles, bowling consistency, over-wise scoring, and venue impact. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the game but also demonstrate how data can drive decisions in sports.
